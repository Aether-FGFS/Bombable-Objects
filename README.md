This are Bombable objects for Flightgear Flight Simulator. 

 Run them as AI scenario and bring them to your location, using 
  Bombable addon menu,  or use them as "airplane" and attack it
  in Multiplayer session.

 Some objects may require proper positioning. Use Flightgear menu, 
  to change position of the object,  in case it appears underground 
  etc. In the case of an aircraft carrier, create it at a waypoint 
  above sea level.
