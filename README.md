This are Bombable Objects for Flightgear Flight Simulator. 
==========================================================


 To use Bombable-Objects, install Bombable v.5.0, updated by
  Helijah. Install it as addon module into Flightgear. 
  

 Installation: Copy AI and Aircraft folder from Bombable-Objects
  and paste it into your Flightgear installation, under fgdata 
  folder. You can add Bombable-Objects to custom folder, and 
  register it in FGFS, but AI must be added into fgdata/AI. 
  AI folder contains AI Scenarios for Bombable-Objects. 


 Run it as AI scenario and bring it to your location, using 
  Bombable addon menu,  or use it as "airplane" and attack it
  in Multiplayer session.
  

 Some objects may require proper positioning. Use Flightgear menu, 
  to change position of the object in case it appears underground 
  etc. In the case of an aircraft carrier, create it at a waypoint 
  above sea level.
  

 In the case of AI objects, some of them may shoot at you AA guns. 

 Have a good luck and lot of fun. :)
